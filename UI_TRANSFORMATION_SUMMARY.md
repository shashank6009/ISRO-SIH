- **Glowing Cyan Accents**: `#00c9ff` (ISRO signature color with glow effects)
- **Professional Typography**: Roboto Mono, Inter, JetBrains Mono for technical precision
- **Animated Elements**: Orbital satellite logo, pulsing status indicators, smooth transitions

## ✨ Enhanced UI Components

### 1. **Persistent Top Navigation Bar**
```css
- Fixed position with backdrop blur
- Live UTC clock (updates every second)
- Animated GENESIS-AI logo with orbital rotation
- System status indicator with pulsing animation
- Professional gradient background
```

### 2. **Enhanced Metric Cards**
```css
- Gradient backgrounds with cyan accents
- Hover animations (lift effect with glow)
- Monospace typography for technical data
- Consistent spacing and alignment
```

### 3. **Live Satellite Tracker**
```css
- Grid layout with satellite status badges
- Real-time error values with confidence intervals
- Hover effects with sliding light animation
- Color-coded by orbit class and error level
```

### 4. **System Health Gauge**
```css
